# py-blackjack

### Playing the game:

1. Make sure you have Python3 installed - you can get a copy (interpreter) from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. From this repo; clone, download the zip or copy-paste the source (into a python file)

3. Navigate / cd into the directory where your newly acquired code resides

4. Run the code with the following line: "python3 blackjack.py" (omit the double-quotes)

5. **Optional**, if you're feeling virtual, use a virtual environment by running the following line: "python3 -m venv .env" (use .env or your choice of folder/directory) (omit the double-quotes)

6. **Optional**, if you chose the virtual path you'll need to hop into that space. Run the following: Ex: "source .env/bin/activate" (where .env is your chosen virtual folder) (omit the double-quotes)

### Description:

<p>a basic game of blackjack / 21 based on an application in the Udemy course of Jose Portilla (also because I was like "nah nah, how is the blackjack game on my phone treating me like this"). In truth computers cannot truly be random like humans so no complaints.</p>
